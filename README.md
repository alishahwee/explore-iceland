# explore-iceland

This is my submittal for the project challenge given by [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page).

This is a mock-up landing page for a fake touring service based in Iceland. This topic was chosen given my recent adventure in Iceland in 2019.

Although the challenge doesn't require it, I utilized the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework for the first time and implemented complete mobile responsiveness as well. Everything was done with just HTML and CSS.

I hope you like it! :smile:
